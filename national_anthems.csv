In furrows of pain   goodness germinates now.        The horrible night has ceased,   the sublime liberty   spills the auroras   of its invincible light.   All humanity,   moans within its chains,   understands the words   of He who died on the Cross.             “Independence!” cries   the American world;   soaked in blood of heroes   the land of Columbus.   Still, one great principle,   “The king is not sovereign”,   resounds, and those who suffer   bless their passion.             The Orinoco’s bed   fills with the remains,   of blood and tears a river   is there seen flowing.   In Bárbula they don’t know   the souls nor the eyes,   if admiration or horror   feel or suffer.             On the shores of the Caribbean,   famished, the people fight,   horrors preferring   to treacherous health.   O, aye! for Cartagena   the abnegation is much,   and the shambles of death   its courage despises.             From Boyacá in the fields,   the genius of glory,   for every ear a hero   undefeated crowned.   Soldiers without breastplate   won victory;   their virile breath   as shield served.             Bolivar crosses the Andes   that two oceans bathe,   swords as sparks   shine in Junín.   Untameable centaurs   descend to the plains,   and a prescience begins to be felt,   of the epic the end.             The victorious trumpet   in Ayacucho thunders,   that in every triumph grows   its formidable sound.   In its expansive thrust   Liberty is worn for the first time,   from the American sky   a pavilion forming.             The virgin her hairs   pulls out in agony   and from her beloved widowed   hangs them on a cypress.   Regretting her hope   covered by a cold headstone,   but glorious pride   hallows her fair skin.             Thus the motherland is formed,   Thermopylaes are breaking forth;   constellation of cyclops   its night brightened.   The trembling flower   finding the wind mortal,   underneath the laurels   safety sought.             But it’s not complete glory   to defeat in battle,   that the arm that fights   is encouraged by truth.   Independence alone   The great clamour doesn’t silence;   if the sun illuminates everyone,   justice is liberty.
